## LARKENHEATH HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA AND ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS

### Larkenheath Design Review Committee (LDRC)

#### INTRODUCTION

Larkenheath is a community subject to recorded covenants and restrictions administered by Meadow Point III & IV and the Larkenheath Homeowners Association.
The Larkenheath Design Review Committee (LDRC) shall periodically review this document to coincide with when Meadow Pointe III & IV review their architectural design document to ensure alignment and reduce ambiguity.
The property within Larkenheath was made subject to these covenants and restrictions for the stated purpose of enhancing property values, amenities and opportunities that contribute to the personal health, welfare and safety of residents.
All residents benefit from the planning and design that have been an important part of the development and character of the Larkenheath community.
In an effort to carry on this tradition of excellence, the Larkenheath Homeowners Association Architectural Standards and Design Criteria, hereafter referred to as Design and Maintenance Standards ("Standards") have been developed and implemented.

The primary purpose of this guide is to familiarize homeowners at Larkenheath with the objectives, scope and application of design standards and guidelines which are intended and will be employed to maintain the aesthetic appearance and environmental quality of the Larkenheath community.
These standards are designed to address exterior improvements, maintenance standards and alterations made by Larkenheath property owners.
Interior alterations are outside the scope of the Standards except when such interior alterations affect the exterior appearance of a property (for example, window coverings).

The authority for the adoption of rules and standards for architectural control by the Board of Directors of the Larkenheath Homeowners Association is found in Article X, Section 2 (a) and of the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions. Authority for Standards is found in Article X, Section 10 of the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions.

If the change is deemed non-compliant by the LDRC, the homeowners must make appropriate changes to bring the alteration into compliance, up to and including removal of the alteration in question.
